    <p> A little bit about me:</p>
    <p> I am a third year Data Science and Math student at Northeastern University, and I'm from New Jersey. 
        Some of my hobbies include watching movies, hanging out with my friends, and trying new restaurants. 
        I also love to travel, and plan on visiting Spain for the first time this year. I've been to roughly 20 countries so far, but I would like to see each continent before I die.
        So far I've been to: 
    </p>
    <ul> 
    <li> North America</li>
    <li> Asia</li>
    <li> Europe</li>
    </ul>   

    <p>I'm also a big fan of learning about where I'm travelling beforehand, and reading about the sights and culture.</p>
