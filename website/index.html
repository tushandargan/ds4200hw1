    <p> A little bit about me:</p>
    <p> I am a third year Data Science and Math student at Northeastern University, and I'm from New Jersey. 
        Some of my hobbies include watching movies, hanging out with my friends, and trying out new restaurants. I also really enjoy looking at fractals - Try clicking on the image above! <br>

        If you clicked on it, you should now see a Koch Snowflake! This is one of the earliest fractals to have been described. It is based on a 1904 paper by Swedish mathematicican Helge Von Koch.

<p> For this Website, I am planning on adding some more features in the future such as:</p>
<ul> 
    <li> Another Page about my appreciation for Fractals</li>
    <li> A page that showcases some of the work I've been doing </li>
    <li> A menu that will allow you to navigate between pages easier</li>
    </ul>  

    <p>I also love to travel, and learn about the sights and culture from other countries. This year, I'm planning on visiting Spain.</p>
